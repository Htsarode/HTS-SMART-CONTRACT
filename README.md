The 1st entry_point is for setting the date for that particular meeting .
The 2nd entry_point is for setting the number of guests attending the meeting . 
The 3rd entry_point is for changing the owner i.e if the owner is change by chance, so that this entry point will be benificial for changing the owner. So, after changing the owner through 3rd entry_point ,the previous owner will not be able to do any modification in the scheduled meeting.
